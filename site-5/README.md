## Features
This template features examples of using Astro Content Collections to create dynamic pages using Markdown. This is a super simple and fast way to generate pages that conform to a predetermined style. 

Writing content in Markdown is way quicker than writing in HTML. This is perfect for announcements and blog post pages. 

Content Collections can also be used for any list-type data such as Team members.
