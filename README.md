# Static Website Templates

This repo holds a collection of pre-made templates that can be used to bootstrap a client site. Templates are made using Astro+TailwindCSS and are meant to serve as a starting point for developing a custom static site for various clients. 

Themes, colours, and fonts can and should be changed to suit the client's brand. 

An optional CMS may be used for sites with expected high turnover of content if needed. Use of a CMS should be determined early and used only if required as it significantly increases complexity of development and deployment.
