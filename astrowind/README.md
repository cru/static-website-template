# Astro TEMPLATE

Heavily inspired by: https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind

> ### [LIVE DEMO](https://cru-template-astrowind.netlify.app/)


## Features
This template features everything. There are examples of pretty much anything you would think to do for a static site. In many cases, it may be simpler to reference this template rather than use it due to the more simplistic nature of sites we will be developing.


## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... images
